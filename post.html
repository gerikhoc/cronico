   <p>Oda likes to use myths, legends and fables, e.g. “fable” backwards = Elbaf. In chinese mythology, there are said to be 4 seas: North, South, East and West
Those 4 seas are represented by four colors: Yellow, Blue, White and Red
They have also been represented by different animals over the time including a Monkey, a Bird, a Dragon, and a Dog

This of course screams:

A north sea with a yellow monkey = Admiral Kizaru
A south sea with a blue bird = Admiral Aokiji
A west sea with a red dog = Admiral Akainu
There is a similar myth that supports this:

The myth is about a king who had 4 loyal followers: One had the shape of a bird, the 2nd the shape of a monkey, the 3rd the shape of a dog, and the last the shape of a pheasant. Some day, the bird realized how evil the king was, so he left his king, but not without letting the other followers know the truth. To his disappointment, the dog was too loyal to his king, the monkey was an idiot and he couldn’t understand what’s going on, and the pheasant was simply too lazy to do something.


 
Now all this resembles the Admirals in One Piece a lot. The colours + the animals + the attitudes! (This time, the bird = dragon)

I believe that Sakazuki’s loyalty to the Navy and the Absolute Justice, Borsalino’s (pretended) goofiness, and Aokiji’s laziness are taken from those myths, hence I believe that the White Dragon, who saw the truth about the evil of his king, is Monkey D. Dragon, Admiral Monkey D. Dragon, with the person of the “King” being taken by the institution of World Government.

Growing up as the son of the famous and renowned Marine officer Monkey D. Garp, combined with the experiences of racism, humiliation and discrimination he made while living on Dawn Island, it’s plausible that Dragon joined the Marine or the WG with hopes of changing the world. But he had to realize (like the Dragon in the myth), that the WG is too evil, too set in their ways, and that the system couldnt be changed. He deserted his position, formed the Revolutionaries and dedicated 100% of his effort to achieving his goal: Changing the world, changing the system, erasing racism, discrimination and humiliation from the world.

I say “dedicate 100%”, because he didnt even take care of his own son, or he wasn’t able to take care of him.

Whatever the case may be, something must have happened in his life, to trigger a young man to abandon his former life and to start a life of secrecy and rebellion. And since love & romance are not a big subject in One Piece at all, I doubt that his Wife (Luffy’s Mom) or even Garp’s Wife (Dragon’s own Mom) have much to do with this. I believe the evil of the WG, that he experienced at first hand, triggered Dragon’s decision to start a revolution.

What do you think about Dragon’s Past?

  <h1>True Power of ‘Flower of Haki’ – Explained</h1>
  <p>Hey everyone! Today, I’ll be talking about Haki, the ‘flower’ of Haki, and it’s true power. Haki is a power that exists within everyone from the One Piece Universe. It is kind of like Ki from Dragon Ball, or Chakra from Naruto, but different in the sense that it d actually the will power of a person. While everyone has access to Haki, not everyone is able to utilize it.

  Haki is only used by the strong people in the world of One Piece, but after the Timeskip, even weak people, like fodder Marines have shown the ability to use Haki. Haki is basically classified into two types. Kenbunshoku Haki, and Busoshoku Haki. Kenbunshoku Haki allows a user to predict a move in the mind’s eye, before the movement had actually been made. It also allows one to gauge the power level of someone, or sense what’s in the surroundings.

The second type of Haki is Busoshoku Haki. This Haki allows one to create an armor from manifesting Haki on a body part. It is used to defend oneself from attacks, and it is also used to increase damage output. This ability also allows a person to hit Devil Fruit users, and is a great weapon against a Logia type. There is also a third type of Haki, but it cannot be awakened by everyone. Only few are gifted with this ability, and it’s called Haoshoku Haki.

It gives the person the ability to intimidate someone, and then overpower them by knocking them out. In the recent chapter of One Piece, we saw a flashback from Rayleigh with Luffy on Rusukaina, where he said that the ‘Flower’ of Haki blooms only when one fights stronger enemies. This basically means that there are levels to Haki, and it’s mastery. What Luffy is suing currently isn’t the maximum potential of Haki.

He will get only stronger, once he fights stronger enemies, and that’s how the ‘flower’ of his Haki will bloom. The levels of Haki have not completely been revealed yet. We’ve seen the advanced level of Observation Haki. Katakuri is its user, and he can look into the future with this ability. That’s not all, though. There is also going to be an advanced level to Armament Haki. I don’t know how that’s going to work really, but it may increase the damage output of a character.

The most impressive thing is definitely going to be the ability to master the next level of Haoshoku Haki. This ability should be what the true power of Haki would be. We’ve seen characters like Shanks use it, and he was able to do damage to have surroundings just by walking, and releasing a small amount of his Haki. Big Mom was also able to damage her surroundings with her Haoshoku Haki, and I’m stoked to see this ability in the future of One Piece.</p>
